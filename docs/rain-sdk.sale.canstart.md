## Sale.canStart property

Can the sale start? Evals `canStartStatePointer` to a boolean that determines whether the sale can start (move from pending to active). Buying from and ending the sale will both always fail if the sale never started. The sale can ONLY start if it is currently in pending status.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
readonly canStart: (overrides?: ReadTxOverrides) => Promise<boolean>;
```
