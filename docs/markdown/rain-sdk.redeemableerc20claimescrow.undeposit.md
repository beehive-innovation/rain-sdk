## RedeemableERC20ClaimEscrow.undeposit property

The inverse of `deposit`<!-- -->.

In the case of a failed distribution the depositors can claim back any tokens they deposited in the escrow.

Ideally the distribution is a success and this does not need to be called but it is important that we can walk back deposits and try again for some future raise if needed.

Delegated `undeposit` is not supported, only the depositor can wind back their original deposit.

`amount` must be non-zero.

If several tokens have been deposited against a given trust for the depositor then each token must be individually undeposited. There is no onchain tracking or bulk processing for the depositor, they are expected to know what they have previously deposited and if/when to process an `undeposit`<!-- -->.
