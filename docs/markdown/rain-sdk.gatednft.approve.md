## GatedNFT.approve property

Gives permission to `to` to transfer `tokenId` token to another account. The approval is cleared when the token is transferred.

Only a single account can be approved at a time, so approving the zero address clears previous approvals.

Requirements:

- The caller must own the token or be an approved operator. - `tokenId` must exist.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
readonly approve: (to: string, tokenId: BigNumberish, overrides?: TxOverrides) => Promise<ContractTransaction>;
```
