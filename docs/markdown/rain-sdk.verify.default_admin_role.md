## Verify.DEFAULT\_ADMIN\_ROLE property

By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`<!-- -->, which means that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other roles.

WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure accounts that have been granted it.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
readonly DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE: (overrides?: ReadTxOverrides) => Promise<string>;
```
