## Verify.renounceRole property

Revokes `role` from the calling account.

Roles are often managed via grantRole and revokeRole: this function's purpose is to provide a mechanism for accounts to lose their privileges if they are compromised (such as when a trusted device is misplaced).

If the calling account had been granted `role`<!-- -->, emits a RoleRevoked event.

Requires the caller to be the `account`<!-- -->.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
readonly renounceRole: (role: BytesLike, account: string, overrides?: TxOverrides) => Promise<ContractTransaction>;
```
