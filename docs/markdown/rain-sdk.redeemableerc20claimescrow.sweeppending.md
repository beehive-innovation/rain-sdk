## RedeemableERC20ClaimEscrow.sweepPending property

Anon can convert any existing pending deposit to a deposit with known rTKN supply once the escrow has moved out of pending status.

As `sweepPending` is anon callable, raise participants know that the depositor cannot later prevent a sweep, and depositor knows that raise participants cannot prevent a sweep. As per normal deposits, the output of swept tokens depends on success/fail state allowing `undeposit` or `withdraw` to be called subsequently.

Partial sweeps are NOT supported, to avoid griefers splitting a deposit across many different `supply_` values.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
readonly sweepPending: (depositor: string, overrides?: TxOverrides) => Promise<ContractTransaction>;
```
