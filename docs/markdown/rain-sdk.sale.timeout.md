## Sale.timeout property

Timeout the sale (move from pending or active to fail). The ONLY condition for a timeout is that the `saleTimeout` block set during initialize is in the past. This means that regardless of what happens re: starting, ending, buying, etc. if the sale does NOT manage to unambiguously end by the timeout block then it can timeout to a fail state. This means that any downstream escrows or similar can always expect that eventually they will see a pass/fail state and so are safe to lock funds while a Sale is active.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
readonly timeout: (overrides?: TxOverrides) => Promise<ContractTransaction>;
```
