## Sale.canEnd property

Can the sale end? Evals `canEndStatePointer` to a boolean that determines whether the sale can end (move from active to success/fail). Buying will fail if the sale has ended. If the sale is out of rTKN stock it can ALWAYS end and in this case will NOT eval the "can end" script. The sale can ONLY end if it is currently in active status.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
readonly canEnd: (overrides?: ReadTxOverrides) => Promise<boolean>;
```
