## EmissionsERC20.transferFrom property

Moves `amount` tokens from `from` to `to` using the allowance mechanism. `amount` is then deducted from the caller's allowance.

Requirements:

- `from` and `to` cannot be the zero address. - `from` must have a balance of at least `amount`<!-- -->. - the caller must have allowance for \`\`<!-- -->from<!-- -->\`\`<!-- -->'s tokens of at least `amount`<!-- -->.

```typescript
readonly transferFrom: (from: string, to: string, amount: BigNumberish, overrides?: TxOverrides) => Promise<ContractTransaction>;
```
