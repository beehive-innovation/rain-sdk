## RedeemableERC20.endDistribution property

The admin can forward or burn all tokens of a single address to end `PHASE_DISTRIBUTING`<!-- -->.

The intent is that during `PHASE_DISTRIBUTING` there is some contract responsible for distributing the tokens.

The admin specifies the distributor to end `PHASE_DISTRIBUTING` and the forwarding address set during initialization is used. If the forwarding address is `0` the rTKN will be burned, otherwise the entire balance of the distributor is forwarded to the nominated address. In practical terms the forwarding allows for escrow depositors to receive a prorata claim on unsold rTKN if they forward it to themselves, otherwise raise participants will receive a greater share of the final escrowed tokens due to the burn reducing the total supply.

The distributor is NOT set during the constructor because it may not exist at that point. For example, Balancer needs the paired erc20 tokens to exist before the trading pool can be built.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
readonly endDistribution: (distributor: string, overrides?: TxOverrides) => Promise<ContractTransaction>;
