## GatedNFT.safeTransferFrom property

Safely transfers `tokenId` token from `from` to `to`<!-- -->, checking first that contract recipients are aware of the ERC721 protocol to prevent tokens from being forever locked.

Requirements:

- `from` cannot be the zero address. - `to` cannot be the zero address. - `tokenId` token must exist and be owned by `from`<!-- -->. - If the caller is not `from`<!-- -->, it must be have been allowed to move this token by either {<!-- -->approve<!-- -->} or {<!-- -->setApprovalForAll<!-- -->}<!-- -->. - If `to` refers to a smart contract, it must implement {<!-- -->IERC721Receiver-onERC721Received<!-- -->}<!-- -->, which is called upon a safe transfer.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
readonly safeTransferFrom: (from: string, to: string, tokenId: BigNumberish, overrides?: TxOverrides) => Promise<ContractTransaction>;
```
