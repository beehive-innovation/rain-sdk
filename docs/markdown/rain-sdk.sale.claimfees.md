## Sale.claimFees property

After a sale ends in success all fees collected for a recipient can be cleared. If the raise is active or fails then fees cannot be claimed as they are set aside in case of refund. A failed raise implies that all buyers should immediately refund and zero fees claimed.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
readonly claimFees: (recipient: string, overrides?: TxOverrides) => Promise<ContractTransaction>;
```
