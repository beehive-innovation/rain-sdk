## Verify.approve property

An `APPROVER` can review added evidence and approve accounts. Typically many approvals would be submitted in a single call which is more convenient and gas efficient than sending individual transactions for every approval. However, as there are many individual agents acting concurrently and independently this requires that the approval process be infallible so that no individual approval can rollback the entire batch due to the actions of some other approver/banner. It is possible to approve an already approved or banned account. The `Approve` event will always emit but the approved block will only be set if it was previously uninitialized. A banned account will always be seen as banned when calling `statusAtBlock` regardless of the approval block, even if the approval is more recent than the ban. The only way to reset a ban is to remove and reapprove the account.
