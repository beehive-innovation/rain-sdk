## RedeemableERC20ClaimEscrow.depositPending property

Depositor can set aside tokens during pending raise status to be swept into a real deposit later.

The problem with doing a normal deposit while the raise is still active is that the `Sale` will burn all unsold tokens when the raise ends. If we captured the token supply mid-raise then many deposited TKN would be allocated to unsold rTKN. Instead we set aside TKN so that raise participants can be sure that they will be claimable upon raise success but they remain unbound to any rTKN supply until `sweepPending` is called.

`depositPending` is a one-way function, there is no way to `undeposit` until after the raise fails. Strongly recommended that depositors do NOT call `depositPending` until raise starts, so they know it will also end.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
readonly depositPending: (amount: BigNumberish, overrides?: TxOverrides | undefined) => Promise<ContractTransaction>;
```
