## EmissionsERC20.allowDelegatedClaims property

Whether the claimant must be the caller of `claim`<!-- -->. If `false` then accounts other than claimant can claim. This may or may not be desirable depending on the emissions schedule. For example, a linear schedule will produce the same end result for the claimant regardless of who calls `claim` or when but an exponential schedule is more profitable if the claimant waits longer between claims. In the non-linear case delegated claims would be inappropriate as third party accounts could grief claimants by claiming "early", thus forcing opportunity cost on claimants who would have preferred to wait.
