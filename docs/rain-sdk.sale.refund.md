## Sale.refund property

Rollback a buy given its receipt. Ignoring gas (which cannot be refunded) the refund process rolls back all state changes caused by a buy, other than the receipt id increment. Refunds are limited by the global cooldown to mitigate rapid buy/refund cycling that could cause volatile price curves or other unwanted side effects for other sale participants. Cooldowns are bypassed if the sale ends and is a failure.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
readonly refund: (receipt: Receipt, overrides?: TxOverrides) => Promise<ContractTransaction>;
```
