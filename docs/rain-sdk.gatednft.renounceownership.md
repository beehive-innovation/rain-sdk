## GatedNFT.renounceOwnership property

Leaves the contract without owner. It will not be possible to call `onlyOwner` functions anymore. Can only be called by the current owner.

NOTE: Renouncing ownership will leave the contract without an owner, thereby removing any functionality that is only available to the owner.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
readonly renounceOwnership: (overrides?: TxOverrides) => Promise<ContractTransaction>;
```
