## VerifyState interface

Records the block a verify session reaches each status. If a status is not reached it is left as UNINITIALIZED, i.e. 0xFFFFFFFF. Most accounts will never be banned so most accounts will never reach every status, which is a good thing.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export interface VerifyState 
```
