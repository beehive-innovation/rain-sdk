## EmissionsERC20.decreaseAllowance property

Atomically decreases the allowance granted to `spender` by the caller.

This is an alternative to `approve()` that can be used as a mitigation for problems described in https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20\#issuecomment-263524729.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
readonly decreaseAllowance: (spender: string, subtractedValue: BigNumberish, overrides?: TxOverrides) => Promise<ContractTransaction>;
```
