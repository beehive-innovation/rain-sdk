## EmissionsERC20.calculateClaim property

Calculates the claim without processing it. Read only method that may be useful downstream both onchain and offchain if a claimant wants to check the claim amount before deciding whether to process it. As this is read only there are no checks against delegated claims. It is possible to return a value from `calculateClaim` and to not be able to process the claim with `claim` if `msg.sender` is not the `claimant`<!-- -->.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
readonly calculateClaim: (claimant: string, overrides?: ReadTxOverrides) => Promise<BigNumber>;
```
